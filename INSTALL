This is the INSTALL file for package Acme::PIA::Export

To install this package, simply unzip the package file and
change into the created directory. There you should only have
to type

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

NOTE: On Win32 systems you may have to type "nmake" instead of "make".




For your convenience I have included scripts for the bash shell and the
Windows cmd that do all of the above:

On Windows Professional systems (NT/2000/XP Pro/Vista) type:
install.cmd

In Bourne compatible shells (Unix/Linux/cygwin) type:
./install.sh
